This example shows a cantilever rod being hit near the base to create an impulse, as in Section 3.1.5 of my dissertation.
A researcher asked for advice on this scenario, and I couldn't find the original code, so I created this example.
I don't remember all the tricks to make the solver converge faster (scaling is important), but this does illustrate
the limitations of the discretization scheme when the problems start to become badly conditioned.
